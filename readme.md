# Home Info Board

This is build to create a website to be used in my "magic mirror" setup at home.
Plan is to run just this website with Raspberry Pi, LCD monitor and a "magic mirror" (= two sided mirror).

## Notes

Everything is configured with hard values (ie. stops, locations). To get HSL Schedul to work, get an API access through
[Digitransit](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/1-routing-api/1-graphiql/)

## Features

- HSL Schedule for nearby stops
- Clock (Need to make it prettier...)
- Date (It's there, basically)
- Weather (Maybe weather.com or something)
